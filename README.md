Loan Approval Credit Risk Predictor

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application should be approved or rejected using machine learning. It is designed to model real-world credit risk assessment by learning patterns from historical loan application data and making data-driven approval decisions.

The system takes into account applicant and loan-related features such as income, loan amount, credit history, education, employment status, and property area. Based on these inputs, the model predicts the likelihood of loan approval, helping automate and standardize the decision-making process.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and supervised learning for binary classification. A Flask-based web interface is used to demonstrate how the trained model can be integrated into a real application, allowing users to input applicant details and receive instant predictions.

This repository serves both as a practical FinTech use case and a learning project for applying machine learning concepts to structured data, building end-to-end ML pipelines, and deploying models in a simple web application.

The project is suitable for academic learning, portfolio demonstration, and as a foundation for more advanced credit risk systems. Future improvements may include more advanced models, explainability techniques, and production-grade deployment.
